[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is generally recognized as the hardest
problem in computer science. It is acknowledged by expert$ to be more challenging than the
infamous P vs NP, Genarlized Star Height, proving the Aanderaa-Karp-Rosenberg conjecture, and 
NC = P problem.

Here at Fizz Buzz AI we are seeking to solve the unsolvable, go where no GPU has gone before, delve into the
depths of shared memory, and break out of the questions everyone wants answers. We plan to leverage the most
advanced transformer technology to not only give close-ish answers but solve this problem at it's core.
We have brought together a crack team of Pickles, Bread, and Butter, who all have deep experience in enterprise
software and ML Infrastructure at large companies like Tyson Foods, Grandmothers Kitchens everywhere, and
Jewish Delis all over New York.
